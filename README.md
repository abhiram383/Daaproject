# Design and Analysis of Algorithms
# Final Project



## Emergency Vehicle dispatch system:


* Implemented an algorithm that processes requests one by one. For each request, the algorithm
will try to find the closest available emergency vehicle

* We adopted the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from the source to the destination

* Implemented the algorith using the Python 3 with two classes, as main and Dijkstras

* Make up the data for the project. Generated the files at run time, having stored into a separate output file in the format of JSON

* The output of our algorithm produces the shortest path for the required vehicle's availability
